              An Ottawa native, Spencer has been involved with hockey in various
              shapes and forms his entire life. Starting young, he has played in
              numerous leagues until he set-out to be as much as a difference maker
              on the bench as on the ice. Spencer has coached for such teams as:
              ##insert teams##, and holds accolades as bringing the first win in
              over 2 years to the famously win-less Surrey Knights of the #league#.

              When he's not jerkin-it, he's talking about hockey. With a passion for
              the NHL and a distaste of immigrants he provides his take on the
              biggest moves in hockey.

              He's cute, and he made this website. In my opinion: the most excellent
              of the bunch. He'll be around whenever something outrageous needs to be said or to spew his
              opinions like a Dilophosaurus spraying acid at Newman.

            The tech handy-man of the show; Tibet handles the sound engineering, the editing and video making. 
            Although he is not really that into hockey, he'll occasionally be brought on to be the neutral voice
            and the litmus test for moves around the NHL.
