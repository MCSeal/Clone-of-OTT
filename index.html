              An Ottawa native, Spencer has been involved with hockey in various
              shapes and forms his entire life. Starting young, he has played in
              numerous leagues until he set-out to be as much as a difference maker
              on the bench as on the ice. Spencer has coached for such teams as:
              ##insert teams##, and holds accolades as bringing the first win in
              over 2 years to the famously win-less Surrey Knights of the #league#.

              When he's not jerkin-it, he's talking about hockey. With a passion for
              the NHL and a distaste of immigrants he provides his take on the
              biggest moves in hockey.

              He's cute, and he made this website. In my opinion: the most excellent
